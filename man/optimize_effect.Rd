\title{Run the Balke optimizer}
\usage{
optimize_effect(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{Object as returned by \link{analyze_graph}}
}
\value{
An object of class "balkebound" that is a list that contains the bounds and logs as character strings and a function to compute the bounds.
}
\description{
Given a object with the linear programming problem set up, compute the bounds
using the c++ code developed by Alex Balke. Bounds are returned as text but can
be converted to R functions using \link{interpret_bounds}, or latex code using
\link{latex_bounds}.
This legacy function has been replaced as default with the more efficient \link{optimize_effect_2}.

\examples{
b <- graph_from_literal(X -+ Y, Ur -+ X, Ur -+ Y)
V(b)$leftside <- c(0,0,0)
V(b)$latent <- c(0,0,1)
V(b)$nvals <- c(2,2,2)
E(b)$rlconnect <- E(b)$edge.monotone <- c(0, 0, 0)
obj <- analyze_graph(b, constraints = NULL, effectt = "p{Y(X = 1) = 1} - p{Y(X = 0) = 1}")
optimize_effect(obj)
}
\seealso{
\link{optimize_effect_2} which is the current default
